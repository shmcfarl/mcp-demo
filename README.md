# MCP Demo

Hello from Cisco DevNet.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a demonstration project with the following file structure:

### Files

- **file-1, file-2, file-3, file-4**: Simple text files containing basic content for demonstration purposes
- **nb-export**: A YAML file containing device information including:
  - Device models
  - Manufacturer names  
  - Part numbers
  - Various network equipment specifications (ADCs, housings, power distribution units, etc.)

### Purpose

This project serves as a demo for MCP (Model Context Protocol) capabilities, showcasing file organization and data structure examples commonly used in network device management and inventory systems.

## Usage

The device data in `nb-export` can be used as reference material for network equipment specifications and part number lookups across multiple manufacturers including A10, AFL, and APC.
